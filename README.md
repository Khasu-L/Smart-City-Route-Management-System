The Smart City Route Management System is a C++ console application that helps manage and optimize city routes using graph data structures and Dijkstra’s algorithm.

It allows users to add, remove, update, view, and sort routes by distance, as well as find the shortest path between two points.

The program demonstrates efficient route management with explainable outputs, showing each step of the algorithm’s decision-making process for transparency and understanding.
